# AI-PI
Currenlty using a ras-pi as a glorified bluetooth dongle for my stereo system, so had the idea for the pi to also be a wireless information hub.

## Usage
```py
python3 AI-PI.py 
#or
python3 [a specific feature].py
```
I like to have it as a `bash alias` or in my `.profile` in the pi's file system so it can boot at power up or login.

## Commandline dependencies
 - `espeak`
 - `wttr.in`

## AI-PI can ...
 - tell you your ip
 - tell you the current time and date
 - tell you the weather and temperature in your local area
 - tell you the current price and percentage change on stocks of your choice
 - tell you a random joke
 
## AI-PI plans to ...
 - be a radio
 - be a metronome
 - tell you the news 
 - be an alarm clock
 - tell you reminders / keep your calander
 - control audio volume
 - read your commands ... `foo@pi~$ AI-PI "what is 2+2?"`
 - listen to you (AI voice recognition)
